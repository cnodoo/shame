== Shell Adept Mail Environment (shame)==

One tool, one job. The Unix philosophy made this very clear
and it makes sense. However, it's up to us to decide, what
a 'job' really is. Nowadays we have a mail client, a feed
reader, a chat client and a lot of web services just to do
a single task: communication.

If you look closer at the protocols and data formats used
-- especially lesser known features -- you realize, they
are all the same. We can transform one into another without
(much) loss. Frack. We reinvented the wheel over and over
again. The parts, that indeed are different, are not widely
used anyway.

Aware of this situation, some mail clients provide the
ability to access usenet or read feeds. Their goal is to
provide an unified information/communication hub, which
is the same for the shame project. However, those clients
are (1) not meant to work together and instead (2) one
ui to rule them all (shame: convert formats and use your
existing "viewer"; currently we convert everything to mail
with is based on personal pereference, but you are welcome
to provide other ones, too, e.g. mail2feed or mail2xmpp..)

 - redefine what a 'job' is.
 - converting formats (focus format x --> mail)
 - unified information infrastructure
 - prototype builts (shell scripts.. to be rewritten)
